# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals for Conversational AI

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity
**Bad Prompt:**
"Help me with my code"

**Good Prompt:**

"I'm getting a 'list index out of range' error in my Python script. Here's the code: [code snippet]. Can you explain what's causing this error and show me how to fix it?"

### 2. Context Setting
Always provide sufficient context for the AI to understand your request.

**Template:**
Context: [What you're working on]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Constraints: [Any limitations or requirements]
Question: [Your specific question]

### 3. Role Definition
Use system messages to establish the AI's role and expertise level.

**Examples:**
- **Beginner Teacher**: "Explain concepts as if teaching a complete beginner. Use simple language and lots of examples."
- **Code Reviewer**: "Review code for bugs, performance issues, and best practices. Provide specific suggestions."
- **Creative Partner**: "Be imaginative and suggest creative alternatives. Think outside the box."

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting
Encourage step-by-step reasoning:
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, identify the problem
2. Then, consider possible solutions
3. Finally, implement the best approach

[Your question here]"

### Few-Shot Learning
Provide examples of desired input/output:
"Convert these statements to questions:
Statement: The meeting is at 3 PM
Question: When is the meeting?
Statement: Python is a programming language
Question: What is Python?
Now convert: The project deadline is Friday"

### Constraint Setting
Be explicit about limitations:
"Write a function that sorts a list. Requirements:

Use Python
Don't use built-in sort() method
Add comments explaining each step
Keep it under 20 lines"

## Testing Your Prompts

### A/B Testing Method
1. Create two versions of your prompt
2. Test with the same set of questions
3. Compare results for:
   - Accuracy
   - Consistency  
   - Helpfulness
   - Relevance

### Iteration Process
1. **Start Simple**: Basic version of your prompt
2. **Identify Issues**: What's not working?
3. **Add Specificity**: Make instructions clearer
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Try unusual inputs
5. **Refine**: Adjust based on results

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being Too Vague**: "Make it better" â†’ "Improve the code's readability by adding comments and using descriptive variable names"

2. **Conflicting Instructions**: Don't say "Be brief but detailed"

3. **Assuming Context**: The AI doesn't remember previous conversations unless you provide that context

4. **Ignoring Token Limits**: Very long prompts may get truncated

5. **Not Testing Variations**: One prompt won't work for all situations
