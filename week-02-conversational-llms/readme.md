# Week 2: Conversational LLMs & Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the second week of our AI course! This week, we're diving into the exciting world of **conversational Large Language Models (LLMs)**. You'll learn the fundamentals of how to build interactive chat experiences, control AI behavior through effective prompting, and create your own chatbot interfaces.

Our focus will be on the core mechanics of chat APIs, the crucial role of system prompts, and the practical skills needed to build and test conversational applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:

* **Understand the structure** of modern chat APIs, including the distinct functions of `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles.
* **Control AI behavior** by crafting effective system prompts to define personality, expertise, and tone.
* **Build a functional chat interface** from the ground up, capable of maintaining conversation history for context.
* **Apply prompt engineering fundamentals** to get clearer, more specific, and more consistent responses from an LLM.
* **Develop a simple web-based chatbot** using Python and the Streamlit library.

## üöÄ How to Get Started

Follow these steps to make the most of this week's materials:

1.  **Setup Your Environment**: Begin with the `setup-guide.md` to install necessary libraries and configure your API keys.
2.  **Learn the Concepts**: Go through the materials in the `resources/readings/` folder. The `prompt-engineering-fundamentals.md` and `chat-roles-guide.md` are essential starting points.
3.  **Explore the Code**: Run the Python scripts in `resources/examples/`. The `basic-chat-cli.py` is the foundation for the assignment, and `streamlit-chatbot.py` shows the final goal.
4.  **Watch the Videos**: Check `videos.md` for curated tutorials that explain the core concepts and walk you through building chatbots.
5.  **Tackle the Assignment**: Open `assignments/week02-assignment.md` and start working through the tasks. Use the `prompt-comparison-rubric.md` to evaluate your system prompts.

##  weekly Assignment Overview

This week's main project involves building a multi-persona chat application. You will:

* **Part 1: Build a Command-Line Chatbot**: Create a basic but functional chat loop in your terminal that maintains conversation history.
* **Part 2: Experiment with System Prompts**: Design and test three different AI personas (e.g., Professional Assistant, Creative Companion) to see how the system prompt dramatically changes the AI's responses.
* **Part 3: Create a Web Interface**: Convert your command-line tool into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, complete with a persona selector.

Refer to `assignments/week02-assignment.md` for detailed requirements, submission guidelines, and evaluation criteria.
