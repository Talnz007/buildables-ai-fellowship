# Week 5 Assignment - LLM Agents & Retrieval Solutions

## Assignment Overview

**Duration**: August 29 - September 4  
**Topic**: LLM Agents & Retrieval (LangChain, LlamaIndex)  
**Format**: Real-World Problem Solving

## Your Mission

Identify a **real business or personal productivity problem** that can be solved using LLM agents with tool integration or document retrieval systems. You'll build a working solution and demonstrate its impact through a video demo and live presentation.

## Deliverables

### 1. Video Demo (5-7 minutes)
**Upload Deadline**: September 21, 11:59 PM

Your video must cover:
- **Problem Identification** (1 min): What real problem are you solving? Who has this problem?
- **Solution Architecture** (2 mins): Technical approach, tools chosen, and why
- **Live Demonstration** (2-3 mins): Working system in action with real data
- **Impact Analysis** (1 min): Measured or projected impact (time saved, accuracy improved, etc.)
- **Technical Challenges** (1 min): Key problems you solved and how

### 2. Live Q&A Presentation

Be prepared to:
- Present your solution in 3-4 minutes
- Answer technical questions about implementation
- Discuss scalability and potential improvements
- Receive and respond to peer feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Core Implementation
✅ **Framework**: Use either LangChain OR LlamaIndex (or both)  
✅ **Tool Integration**: Implement at least ONE external tool (calculator, web search, API call, file system)  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user feedback  
✅ **Working Demo**: Fully functional system (local deployment acceptable)  
✅ **Real Data**: Test with actual documents/data, not dummy content

### Code Quality Standards
✅ **Documentation**: Clear README with setup instructions  
✅ **Code Structure**: Organized, readable Python code  
✅ **Dependencies**: requirements.txt with specific versions  
✅ **Environment**: Proper API key management (.env file)  
✅ **Testing**: Basic error handling and edge case management

## Problem Categories (Choose Your Own - Don't Copy These!)

- Customer service automation for a specific domain
- Competitive research and analysis automation
- Compliance checking and documentation

### Personal Productivity  
- Personal knowledge management system
- Research assistant for specific field of study
- Email/communication automation
- Learning and skill development assistant

### Creative Applications
- Content research and generation pipeline

- Social media management with intelligent responses
- Creative writing assistance with fact-checking

## Implementation Examples

### Option A: LangChain Agent with Tools
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, Calculator
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Your custom tool
class CustomBusinessTool(BaseTool):
    name = "business_analyzer"
    description = "Analyzes business documents for key insights"
    
    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Your implementation
        return analysis_result

# Agent setup
tools = [DuckDuckGoSearchRun(), Calculator(), CustomBusinessTool()]
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, 
    OpenAI(), 
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory
)
```

### Option B: LlamaIndex Document Q&A System
```python
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
from llama_index.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever

# Document processing
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('your_documents/').load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Query engine setup
retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(index=index, similarity_top_k=3)
query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(retriever=retriever)

# Your custom processing logic
def process_business_query(query: str):
    response = query_engine.query(query)
    # Add your analysis logic
    return enhanced_response
```
