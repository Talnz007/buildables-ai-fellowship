# Week 3 – Advanced Prompting

**Dates:** Aug 15–21

## Topic
Advanced prompt techniques: few-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

## Objectives
- Learn how to use few-shot prompting by including examples in prompts.
- Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning ability.
- Understand how zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompting compare in practice.

## Hands-on Project
- Test a logic puzzle with:
  1. Zero-shot prompt
  2. Few-shot prompt (with examples)
  3. CoT prompt (“think step by step”)
- Compare the model’s accuracy across these approaches.
- Prompt the model: *“Explain your reasoning”* to practice CoT responses.
