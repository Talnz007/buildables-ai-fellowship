# Week 3: Advanced Prompt Techniques

## ðŸŽ¯ Topics & Objectives

### Topic
[cite_start]Advanced prompt techniques, focusing on **few-shot** and **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting. 

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
1.  [cite_start]**Utilize few-shot prompting** by including examples in your prompts to guide model behavior. 
2.  [cite_start]**Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** to elicit step-by-step reasoning from large language models. 
3.  **Compare the performance** of zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT prompts on reasoning-based tasks.
4.  **Develop a systematic approach** to evaluating and improving prompt effectiveness.

## ðŸ’» Hands-on Project: Prompt Comparison Lab

[cite_start]The main project for this week is to conduct a comparative analysis of different prompting strategies. 

### Core Tasks
1.  [cite_start]**Test a Logic Puzzle**: Implement and test a logic puzzle using three distinct prompting methods: 
    * [cite_start]**(a) Zero-shot prompt**: Ask the model for a direct answer without examples. 
    * [cite_start]**(b) Few-shot prompt**: Provide 2-3 solved examples before presenting the new problem. 
    * [cite_start]**(c) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt**: Explicitly ask the model to "think step by step" or explain its reasoning. 
2.  [cite_start]**Compare Accuracy**: Measure and compare the accuracy of the outputs from each prompting method. 
3.  [cite_start]**Practice CoT**: Use phrases like "Explain your reasoning" to encourage the model to produce a detailed thought process. 

## ðŸ”— Relevant Links & Resources

* [cite_start]**OpenAI Prompting Guide**: Review official documentation for examples of zero-shot and few-shot prompting. 
* [cite_start]**Chain-of-Thought Paper (ICLR 2022)**: Read the original research paper that introduced CoT prompting to understand its foundations. 

## ðŸ“š Supplementary Materials & Activities

* [cite_start]**Create an Evaluation Rubric**: Develop a rubric to systematically score and compare the quality of the model's outputs. 
* [cite_start]**Peer Review Session**: Exchange prompts with classmates to analyze different approaches and examine the resulting differences in model responses.
