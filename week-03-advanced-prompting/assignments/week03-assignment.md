# Week 3 Assignment

## Title
Advanced Prompting: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

## Instructions
1. Select reasoning tasks from the provided datasets (`logic-puzzles.json`, `math-problems.json`, etc.).
2. For each task, apply three prompting strategies:
   - Zero-shot
   - Few-shot
   - CoT (“think step by step”)
3. Collect outputs and evaluate them using the [Reasoning Evaluation Rubric](reasoning-evaluation-rubric.md).

## Deliverables
- A report (markdown or notebook) with:
  - Prompts
  - Model responses
  - Rubric-based evaluation
  - Comparative insights

## Bonus
- Trade prompts with a peer and test each other’s designs.
- Document how the model’s reasoning changes with small modifications in prompt wording.
