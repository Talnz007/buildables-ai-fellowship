# Practical Considerations: Cost, Tokens, and Limits

Using LLM APIs is powerful, but it's not free. [cite_start]Understanding the cost structure and technical limitations is essential for building sustainable and efficient applications[cite: 3].

## What is a Token?

A "token" is the basic unit of text that models process. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation.

* **Rule of Thumb**: For common English text, **1 token ≈ 4 characters** or **100 tokens ≈ 75 words**.

This is important because API pricing and model context windows are both measured in tokens.

## API Pricing

LLM providers typically charge per **1,000 tokens**. The pricing is often split into two categories:

1.  **Input Tokens (Prompt)**: The number of tokens in the text you send to the model.
2.  **Output Tokens (Completion)**: The number of tokens in the text the model generates for you.

Often, output tokens are more expensive than input tokens. More powerful models (like GPT-4 or Gemini 1.5 Pro) are significantly more expensive than smaller, faster models (like GPT-3.5 Turbo or Gemini 1.0 Pro).

**Always check the official pricing page of your API provider before starting a project.**

## Context Window (Token Limit)

Every model has a **maximum context window**, which is the total number of tokens (input + output) it can handle in a single API call.

* **Example**: If a model has a 4,096 token context window, the sum of your prompt tokens and the `max_tokens` you request for the output cannot exceed 4,096.

If your input text is too long, you will receive an error. For processing very long documents, you will need to use strategies like:
* **Chunking**: Breaking the document into smaller pieces and processing each one separately.
* **Using Models with Larger Context Windows**: Newer models are being released with much larger context windows (e.g., 128k or even 1 million tokens), but they are typically more expensive.

## Best Practices for Cost Management

* **Be Concise**: Make your prompts as short and clear as possible.
* **Set `max_tokens`**: Always set a reasonable `max_tokens` limit to prevent unexpectedly long and expensive responses.
* **Choose the Right Model**: Don't use the most powerful (and expensive) model if a cheaper one can do the job just as well.
* **Monitor Your Usage**: Use the dashboard provided by the API provider to track your spending.
