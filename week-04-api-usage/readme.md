# Week 4: LLM API Usage for Generation and Summarization

Welcome to Week 4! This week, we transition from crafting prompts to programmatically interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) through their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

You will learn how to send requests to powerful models like those from OpenAI and Google (Gemini) to perform tasks like text generation, summarization, and question-answering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1.  **Call LLM APIs**: Write Python scripts to send text to an LLM API and receive a generated response.
2.  **Perform Summarization**: Use an LLM to summarize a news article or document.
3.  **Implement Q&A**: Ask an LLM specific questions about a provided text.
4.  **Tune API Parameters**: Understand and experiment with parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens` to control the creativity and length of the model's output.
5.  **Evaluate Outputs**: Compare the results from different models and settings to understand their unique strengths and weaknesses.

## This Week's Structure

* **Readings**: Start with the guides in `resources/readings` to understand the fundamentals of API calls, key parameters, and the practical considerations of token limits.
* **Setup**: Follow the `setup-guide.md` to get your API keys and install the necessary Python libraries.
* **Assignment**: The main project this week is in `assignments/week04-assignment.md`. You will build a Python script to summarize an article and ask questions about it.
* **Examples**: The `resources/examples` folder will contain sample scripts showing how to call the OpenAI and Gemini APIs (to be added).
