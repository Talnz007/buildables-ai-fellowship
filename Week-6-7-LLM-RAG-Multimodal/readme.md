# Week 6-7: PDF Automation, RAG & Multimodal LLMs - README
  
**Combined Topics:** Document Processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Multimodal AI

---

## 📋 Overview

This combined week covers two crucial aspects of modern AI applications:
1. **Document Intelligence & RAG** - Extracting, processing, and intelligently retrieving information from documents
2. **Multimodal LLMs** - Working with AI models that can process both text and images
